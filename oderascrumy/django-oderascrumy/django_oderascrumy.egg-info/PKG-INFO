Description: 
        Scrumy is a ridiculously simple and super intuitive project management tool designed for planning various tasks in a project. Essentially functioning as a virtual big board with sticky notes, Scrumy is great for one organizationally challenged student to plan their tasks on a project, for small groups which need to accomplish a number of tasks in a medium sized project, and even works wonderfully for a class sized project with multiple tasks and roles. A major strength of the program is that it is free and so simple that students barely need to be taught how to use it.

                'oderascrumy',
            ]
        
        2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            path('', include('oderascrumy.urls')),
